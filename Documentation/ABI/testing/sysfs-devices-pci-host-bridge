Description:
		A PCI host bridge device parents a PCI bus device topology. PCI
		controllers may also parent host bridges. The DDDD:BB format
		conveys the PCI domain (ACPI segment) number and root bus number
		(in hexadecimal) of the host bridge. Note that the domain number
		may be larger than the 16-bits that the "DDDD" format implies
		for emulated host-bridges.

Description:
		(RO) Symlink to the platform firmware device object "companion"
		of the host bridge. For example, an ACPI device with an _HID of
		PNP0A08 (/sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/LNXSYBUS:00/PNP0A08:00). See
		/sys/devices/pciDDDD:BB entry for details about the DDDD:BB
		format.

What:		pciDDDD:BB/streamH.R.E
Contact:	linux-pci@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		(RO) When a platform has established a secure connection, PCIe
		IDE, between two Partner Ports, this symlink appears. A stream
		consumes a Stream ID slot in each of the Host bridge (H), Root
		Port (R) and Endpoint (E).  The link points to the Endpoint PCI
		device in the Selective IDE Stream pairing. Specifically, "R"
		and "E" represent the assigned Selective IDE Stream Register
		Block in the Root Port and Endpoint, and "H" represents a
		platform specific pool of stream resources shared by the Root
		Ports in a host bridge. See /sys/devices/pciDDDD:BB entry for
		details about the DDDD:BB format.

What:		pciDDDD:BB/available_secure_streams
Contact:	linux-pci@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		(RO) When a host bridge has Root Ports that support PCIe IDE
		(link encryption and integrity protection) there may be a
		limited number of Selective IDE Streams that can be used for
		establishing new end-to-end secure links. This attribute
		decrements upon secure link setup, and increments upon secure
		link teardown. The in-use stream count is determined by counting
		stream symlinks. See /sys/devices/pciDDDD:BB entry for details
		about the DDDD:BB format.
