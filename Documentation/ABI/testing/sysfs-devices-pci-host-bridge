Description:
		A PCI host bridge device parents a PCI bus device topology. PCI
		controllers may also parent host bridges. The DDDD:BB format
		conveys the PCI domain (ACPI segment) number and root bus number
		(in hexadecimal) of the host bridge. Note that the domain number
		may be larger than the 16-bits that the "DDDD" format implies
		for emulated host-bridges.

Description:
		(RO) Symlink to the platform firmware device object "companion"
		of the host bridge. For example, an ACPI device with an _HID of
		PNP0A08 (/sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00/LNXSYBUS:00/PNP0A08:00). See
		/sys/devices/pciDDDD:BB entry for details about the DDDD:BB
		format.
