Description:
		"tsmN" is a device that represents the generic attributes of a
		platform TEE Security Manager.  It is typically a child of a
		platform enumerated TSM device. /sys/class/tsm/tsmN/uevent
		signals when the PCI layer is able to support establishment of
		link encryption and other device-security features coordinated
		through a platform tsm.

Contact:	linux-pci@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		(RO) When a host bridge has established a secure connection via
		the platform TSM, symlink appears. The primary function of this
		is have a system global review of TSM resource consumption
		across host bridges. The link points to the endpoint PCI device
		and matches the same link published by the host bridge. See
		Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-devices-pci-host-bridge.

What:		/sys/class/tsm/tsmN/pci_mode
Contact:	linux-coco@lists.linux.dev
Description:
		(RO) A TSM with PCIe TDISP capability can be in one of two
		modes.

		    "link": typically for a hypervisor (VMM) to authenticate,
			    establish a secure session, and setup link
			    encryption.

		    "devsec": typically for a confidential guest (TVM) to
			      transition assigned devices through the TDISP
			      state machine UNLOCKED->LOCKED->RUN.

		See the "tsm/" entries in
		Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-pci for the available PCI
		device attributes when a TSM with the given "pci_mode" is
		registered.
