Description:
		(RO) When a host bridge has established a secure connection via
		the platform TSM, symlink appears. The primary function of this
		is have a system global review of TSM resource consumption
		across host bridges. The link points to the endpoint PCI device
		and matches the same link published by the host bridge. See
		Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-devices-pci-host-bridge.
